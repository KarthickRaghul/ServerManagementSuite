## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarthickRaghul/ServerManagementSuite
```

---

### 2. Install Vite

#### ü™ü On Windows (CMD or PowerShell):

```cmd
npm install -g vite
```

#### üêß On Linux:

```bash
sudo npm install -g vite
```

---

### 3. Install PostgreSQL

#### ü™ü On Windows:

1. Download the installer from the official site: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
3. Set the port (e.g., `8500`) and credentials (username and password) during installation.
4. After installation, ensure `pgAdmin` and the PostgreSQL service are running.

#### üêß On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

> Optional: Change the default port or authentication settings by editing `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`.

---

### 4. Set Up the Environment File

Create a `.env` file inside the backend directory:

```
ServerSecurityTool/backend/.env
```

Add the following content:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:8500/SSMS?sslmode=disable
CLIENT_PORT=2210
CLIENT_PROTOCOL=http
JWT_SECRET=vanakamdamapla
SERVER_PORT=8000
LOG_LEVEL=info

SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=servermanagementcit@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=tgekktudhggxwpok
SMTP_FROM=SMS Alerts <servermanagementcit@gmail.com>
```

#### üìò Breakdown of Important Environment Variables:

- **DATABASE_URL** ‚Üí PostgreSQL connection string  
  - **postgres** ‚Üí PostgreSQL username  
  - **password** ‚Üí PostgreSQL password  
  - **localhost** ‚Üí Database host (can be IP if remote)  
  - **8500** ‚Üí PostgreSQL port  
  - **SSMS** ‚Üí Database name  
  - **sslmode=disable** ‚Üí Disables SSL for local/dev use

- **CLIENT_PORT** ‚Üí Port used by client agents to connect  
- **CLIENT_PROTOCOL** ‚Üí Communication protocol (e.g., http/https)  
- **JWT_SECRET** ‚Üí Secret key for JWT token signing  
- **SERVER_PORT** ‚Üí Port used by the backend server  
- **LOG_LEVEL** ‚Üí Logging level (e.g., info, debug, warn, error)  

- **SMTP_HOST** ‚Üí Mail server host  
- **SMTP_PORT** ‚Üí Mail server port (587 for TLS)  
- **SMTP_USERNAME** ‚Üí Email address for SMTP auth  
- **SMTP_PASSWORD** ‚Üí SMTP password or app password  
- **SMTP_FROM** ‚Üí Display name and sender email for alerts


---

### 5. Run the Backend

#### ü™ü On Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):

```powershell
cd ServerSecurityTool/backend
go run main.go
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to **Run PowerShell as Administrator** to allow access to system resources.

#### üêß On Linux:

```bash
cd ServerSecurityTool/backend
sudo go run main.go
```

---

### 6. Run the Frontend

In a new terminal window:

```bash
cd ServerSecurityTool/frontend
npm run dev -- --host
```

> This will launch the frontend and make it accessible over the local network.

---

## üíª Client Setup

The client tool collects system metrics and sends data to the backend.

---

### Option 1: Clone Client on Server Machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarthickRaghul/ServerManagementSuite/tree/main/client
cd client
```

Run the client:

#### ü™ü On Windows:

```powershell
go run windows\main.go
```

> Run in PowerShell **as Administrator**.

#### üêß On Linux:

```bash
sudo go run linux\main.go
```

---

### Option 2: Build on Any Machine and Copy to Server

1. Build the client:

```bash
go build -o client_tool main.go
```

2. Copy the compiled binary to your server via SCP, USB, or file transfer.

3. Run on the server:

#### üêß Linux:

```bash
sudo ./client_tool
```

#### ü™ü Windows:

```powershell
.\client_tool.exe
```

‚úÖ Your ServerSecurityTool stack (backend, frontend, and client) is now fully set up and running.
