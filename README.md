# Server Management Suite (SMS)

A centralized, secure, and scalable platform for managing Linux servers across institutional networks, data centers, and enterprises.

---

## üß≠ Overview

**Server Management Suite (SMS)** is an all-in-one server management solution designed to simplify and centralize the administration of multiple Linux-based and Windows-based servers. Through a modern web interface, SMS allows system administrators to:

- Monitor server health in real time
- Configure system and network settings remotely
- Manage users and roles
- Receive proactive alerts
- Streamline operations across fleets of servers

Built with a modular architecture and robust security, SMS is ideal for universities, enterprises, and data centers seeking to reduce downtime and improve operational efficiency.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Recommended)

### Docker Deployment (Easiest Method)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Git installed

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KarthickRaghul/ServerManagementSuite
   cd ServerManagementSuite
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

3. **Run Setup Script**
   
   #### üêß On Linux:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   
   #### ü™ü On Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):
   ```powershell
   .\setup.ps1
   ```

4. **Start Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

‚úÖ **That's it!** Your SMS is now running at `http://localhost:3000`

The setup scripts will:
- Validate Docker installation
- Configure environment variables
- Build Docker images for backend, frontend, and database
- Initialize the PostgreSQL database
- Start all services automatically

---

## üê≥ Docker Architecture

SMS uses three Docker containers:

| Container | Image | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **sms-backend** | `sms-backend:latest` | Go API server with JWT auth |
| **sms-frontend** | `sms-frontend:latest` | React dashboard with Vite |
| **sms-database** | `postgres:15` | PostgreSQL database |

**Docker Compose Features:**
- Automatic service dependency management
- Volume persistence for database data
- Network isolation and security
- Health checks for all services
- Auto-restart policies

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Manual Installation (Advanced)

For users who prefer manual setup or need customization beyond Docker:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarthickRaghul/ServerManagementSuite
```

---

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Install Vite

**ü™ü On Windows (CMD or PowerShell):**
```cmd
npm install -g vite
```

**üêß On Linux:**
```bash
sudo npm install -g vite
```

#### Install Go
- Download from: https://golang.org/dl/
- Follow installation instructions for your OS

---

### 3. Install PostgreSQL

#### ü™ü On Windows:

1. Download the installer from: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)
2. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard
3. Set the port (e.g., `8500`) and credentials during installation
4. Ensure `pgAdmin` and PostgreSQL service are running

#### üêß On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

> Optional: Change the default port or authentication settings by editing `/etc/postgresql/<version>/main/postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`.

---

### 4. Set Up the Environment File

Create a `.env` file inside the backend directory:

```
ServerSecurityTool/backend/.env
```

Add the following content:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:password@localhost:8500/SSMS?sslmode=disable
CLIENT_PORT=8080

### 5. Run the Backend

#### ü™ü On Windows (PowerShell as Administrator):

```powershell
cd ServerSecurityTool/backend
go mod download
go run main.go
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to **Run PowerShell as Administrator** to allow access to system resources.

#### üêß On Linux:

```bash
cd ServerSecurityTool/backend
go mod download
sudo go run main.go
```

---

### 6. Run the Frontend

In a new terminal window:

```bash
cd ServerSecurityTool/frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host
```

> This will launch the frontend and make it accessible over the local network.

---

## üíª Client Setup

The client tool collects system metrics and sends data to the backend.

---

### Option 1: Clone Client on Server Machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KarthickRaghul/ServerManagementSuite/tree/main/client
cd client
```

Run the client:

#### ü™ü On Windows:

```powershell
go run windows\main.go
```

> Run in PowerShell **as Administrator**.

#### üêß On Linux:

```bash
sudo go run linux\main.go
```

---

### Option 2: Build on Any Machine and Copy to Server

1. Build the client:

```bash
go build -o client_tool main.go
```

2. Copy the compiled binary to your server via SCP, USB, or file transfer.

3. Run on the server:

#### üêß Linux:

```bash
sudo ./client_tool
```

#### ü™ü Windows:

```powershell
.\client_tool.exe
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Environment variables are managed via `.env` files for backend, frontend, and client agents. Sensitive data (secrets, DB credentials) should be kept secure and excluded from version control.

**Docker Environment:**
- Environment variables are automatically loaded from `.env` file
- Database credentials are managed through Docker secrets
- SSL certificates can be mounted as volumes

---

## üöÄ Deployment Strategy

### Production Deployment

1. **Docker Deployment (Recommended)**
   - Deploy on a central server within your secure network
   - Use `docker-compose.prod.yml` for production settings
   - Configure reverse proxy (nginx) for SSL termination
   - Set up backup strategies for database volumes

2. **Manual Deployment**
   - Install dependencies on production server
   - Configure systemd services for auto-start
   - Set up log rotation and monitoring
   - Configure firewall rules

3. **Client Distribution**
   - Distribute the client agent to each Linux or Windows server
   - Use configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet) for scale
   - Set up monitoring for client connectivity

---

## üéØ Conclusion

SMS empowers IT teams to manage, monitor, and secure large-scale Linux server environments from a single, intuitive interface. With Docker support, deployment is now simpler than ever, while the manual installation option provides flexibility for advanced users. Its modular, secure, and extensible design makes it a practical choice for institutions and enterprises seeking operational excellence.
